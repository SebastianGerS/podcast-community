# events and some buggfixes

Today I have added emitions of events upon creating event to users that follow the user that's creating the event but is not the target of the event (if you are the target you will get an notification instead), also this is just for a few event types which I have deemed as things that could be of intrest to followers (subscriptions, following other users, reccomendations to other users and ratings).

I also added the creation of rating events, hade to modify some of the func to populate the events as well as changing from objectId to string id's for Ratings, this is becouse I have to specify the type of the object field on the events adn eventought I can allow diffrent models I can't allow different types of keys for touse models and since the otherone have _id's that are just regular strings (the ids for episodes and podcasts comes from listenNotes).

On the front end side I added functions to add the emited event to the events array and added listeners for those emitions I also made some changes in how recommendations and ratings are sent to the backend I now also send images and names of the recommended objects to enable emiting thoes to the relevant users without having to fetch the images and names from listennotes again this also requierd some changes in the backend.

Some smaler syling changes where made and the layout for rating events was created. Also limited how long episdeo/podcast/user names that can be friten out on events and notifications.
