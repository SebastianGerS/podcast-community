# sprintplaning and notifications

I Started the day with some sprint planing, tried to separate the issues into smaler parts, also spent some time thinking about how to get notifications and the user feed (events) working in a good way, and the way I'm planing to go now is to have a route for both events and notifications using a offset param for pagination like for podcasts episodes on individual podcasts ("infinate scroll") and then use sockets to get new notifications that can be pushed to the top of the notifications array.

I also created the notifications modal and the route for fetching all the notifications for a user. Reworked th elogic for which events should trigger the creation of notifications, work a bit with mogooses poppulate to get ntoifications with their event data and also made a infinite scroll for the notifications modal. Next step is to enable deletion of notifications and also enable marking them as viwed and after that I will start to look at sockets and how to best implement that for this project.
