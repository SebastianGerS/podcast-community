# Adding view and route for individual episode, restricting access to private profiles and restricting react dev tools

I started out by creating the basic markup for the episode view and then looked at how to best fetch a single episode from the api. I'm A bit bothered by the inconsitences of the episode object, it contains diffrent params depending on if u get it by using hte listenNotes /search path or if you get it by using /episodes suprisingly enuf you get much mor info when searching, any way the descriptions returned by the api when fetching individual episodes sometimes contains html (stringifyed) I'm a bit botherd by this thought I hav started to contenplate if I perhaps should process this markupp and use it to perhaps get better line breaks etc, but for now I'm just replacing all the html with help of a regexp.

I was able to finish that view (more or less) and the moved on to looking at restricting access to user profiles. They are already som what restricted in the sens that you cant view the profiles if you are not logged in, but I added a check to prevent private profiles to be viewd (fully) unless you have requests access( are following the user), if you are an admin or if the profile is your own.

I also started to think about how the react devtools work and realised that the information I was hideing is availible via the react dev tools so I search around a bit and found a way block the dev tool when in production, I have not tried it out in my production env yeat but hoppfully it works, still the data is availible if you just know how to get your hands on it but it's not any thing super sensitive just email, age and bio, when it comes to more sensitve data that's always beeing encoded befor beeing sent and are also encrypted before beeing stored in the database.
