# "finishing" ratings and created basic view and subcomponents for userfeed and start of method to fetch events

So today I started with adding some func to controle which star icon is displayed for each podcast/episode I also added a new white star to show if the episode is not rated. I also added a sucess massage when rating an episode so that users know that theri vote was registered, I tought about createing events upon doing a rating but i'm waiting a bit with that perhaps I will look at that when I have the basics for the user feed (with events). I also hade some problems with my database that seamd to convert flotes to integers when the value was for example 4.0, I actualy ended up fixing this on the froned side of things thought with (toFixed), it's just a visualy mather any way.

I also created a view for the user feed and some subcomponets with logic to determin what to reder for which types of events
I just used some dummy data for the events in the feed for now.

I started to look at fetching the events and I will have to (just like for the notifications) fetch some data from the listen notes api for some of the events, becouse it's also the events that are updated in the notifications I should be able to extract most of it to a function that I can use for both, I also realized that the new version of the listennotes api actualy allow for batch fetching episodes and podcasts so I should also rewrite the func thats used for fetching the episodes and podcasts data for the notifications(events) to fetch all of them att the same time (not just one by on) and them sort them. I started working on this and got part of the way hopfully I will be able to finish that to morow.
