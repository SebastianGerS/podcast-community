# # online/offline user status and some follows bugfixes

So to day I have done most part of setting up the func to get user online/offline status, I have also refactord a few things and moved most things related to sockets to it's own file. I still have a few problems tought, as it is now you get the current state of whoes loged in or not when you log in and then you get the updates as other followers/following logs in and out. The problem is that if you start to follow some one new you are not geting theri status until it changes (so thay will be listed as offline untilt ther's  a change) also if you stop following a user they will disapere from the follows modal but their status will still be in the userStatuses and this will be a problem becouse as long as ther is users in userStatuses the follows icon will indicate that ther's people online, so I will have to look some more tomorrow on how to remedy this.

I also refactored some func to get follows for a user and then reused that to enable emiting updates on follows when events that trigger updates on follows are triggerd, this helpt me getting realtime updates for number of followers and following on user profile as well as alowing me to simplify the checks to determine the status of a request to a user in the followsButton component.
I also made som smaler changes to the colors of the icons and usercards for the follows modal and created a useSocket hook to enable me to remove a loot of code duplication.
