#user feed (events) and notification omptimizations

So today I finished the route for fetching events of followers, I made som functions to enable fetching all episdoes and podcasts asocieted with the fetched events witch just one call to listen notes per type (episode, podcast) and then sort the results into the correct events. This is probably what I should have done from the start with notifications to so i rewrote the code for fetching listen notes data to the notifications to use the func for events.

I found some buggs for subscriptions due to it now beeing manditory to send and object with when doing a post request to the create and I hade forgotten to update the toggleSubscription action to send this with the request.

I also created new functions and a new events key in the eventReducer and connected the feed compontent to get the events data and made some minor changes to the feed layout.
