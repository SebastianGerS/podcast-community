# more audio buggs

To day I evetualy managed to solve issue with the loader while whaiting for the the file to buffer (on load and if seek is set), this took quite a while, and the solution does not feel vary robust but it will have to do for now. I emidiatly ran in to another problem tought, at first I thought that the changes I made hade coused this eventought it seamd unlikly, on the safari and firefox browser on my phone I could not play any audio files (or so I tought) I tried changeing things back and forth and I was just about to remove the latest few commits and try again ( I made several deploys to the stageing enviroment to check on between) when I discovered that some episodes actually where playable and that this probably has been the case from the start. I also realized that this was mostlikly due to some files having the content-type application/octet-stream and theese files where not playable on the safari or firfox in ios.

I hade been using the dev tools while having the phone connected to my mac book to look att the differense between the requests for audio that where playable and thoses that where not and doin new deploys between each change (connecting to the localhost on the phone via the laptops ip does not enable one to make requests to the api) but I then found that It's actualy possible to simulate the limitations of the safari browser on a laptop by changing: Develop -> User Agent to the desiered device, so this way I can atleast continue testing for this localy eventought I'm not sure how to solve this yet, I don't know if it's possible to add some kind of acception to this rule or meaby fore the mime type to be of a sertain type or just change it before passing it from the api to the client (I'm just pipeing the stream via my api to avoid corse issues at the moment) altought this seams unsafe and also inital tries to changes the mime type of the stream where unsucessfull.
