# bugfixes and planing

Today I disovered a bug where the content of playback modal was squished togheter when viewd on my mobile phone, this was not visible while using devtools on mt laptop, but the same problem did appear when looking at a x-code iphone simulation and after a little while I was able to solve it (flex: 1 was needed on the main content of the modal).

I also did a deploy to both the staging and production enviroment and then started to plan the next sprint which will consit of bugg fixes and minor improvments. After I was done with the planing I started looking at seeding the database, first I hade some trouble finding a good tool to do this so initialy I just made my own seeder to be triggerd if a certain condision was met (a specific user was not in the database) after connecting to the database. But then I found mongoose-data-seed which matched what I wanted to to weary well, I took a while before I was able to get it to work the way I wanted to tought but evetualy it worked so now it's possible to seed the database from whithin the container using with a yarn coman (yarn md-seed run), for now the only thing I'm seeding is a admin user, this is important becouse if you can't create a admin user from whith in the application without having a admin (only admins can create other admins or change the user type of another user).

I also added buttons for closing the modals, previusly only some of the modals hade those kinds of buttons (it was possible to close the modals before as well, but it was as apparent how to do that as it is now). I also added a new action to allow closing which ever modal is open when navigating to the start page by clicking on the logo or the site-header, when klicking on the register button and when a search is triggerd. I also refactored how redirections are made now al redirections are made with a redirect that's rendered in the siteroute.
