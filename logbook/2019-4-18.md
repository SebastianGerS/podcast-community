# Finishing follows online status

Not done much today but I have atleast solved the problem with not getting online status emidiatly when following/beingfollowed by some one new. This work now I created a new listener on the server and made it so that the client will emit what thw current users id if the count of the users followers or followings are changed and that emit will couse the server to send the array with all the loggedin users that the user curently is following. I made an limitation when subscribing as well as I mentioned that I should do in a priviouse log, I have now limited cals to fetch the latest episode to only be instageted if no user is currently following that podcast when the new subsription is made.

also added a simple info text for users with a empty follows modal (they are not following any one and no one is following them)
I deployed to both the main site and the dev site as well today and did some manual testing, things seams to work as acspected tought I'm still unsure if the notifications for new episodes is actualy working but I should know by next week atlest, if it's not working I will have to look at it some more during the bugfix/documentation sprint (last two weeks)
