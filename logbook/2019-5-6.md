# playback buggs

Today I have been trying to fix the play back so that it's a bit more consistent, been trying to find out exactly what goes wrong when things goes wrong and ended up mostly focusing on showing a loader while loding the file and while seeking a new posistion and setting a restrictin so that it's not possible to update the isPlaying state while buffering. That mostyl wokring now tought I'm haveing trouble with the loader disapearing to early just to reaper for a split second before the file acually starts playing, the main problem here is as I see it that the react-howler player which I'm using does not provide a state for checking if it's done buffering (you can check to se if the file is loaded tought but this seams to only apply to en initial loading of the file) So I'm trying to check if the possition remains unchanged or rather within a smal margin from the prevPos (which for some reason does not seam to exactly correspond to the priviously logged "current" possition so I'm checking with in a smal margin of error)
