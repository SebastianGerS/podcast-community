# exploring the listenNotes api, updating error handeling in the api, adding new func to fetch episodes for a podcast and adding infinate scroll

So to day I started out thinking about how I could go about fetching the episodes for a single podcast (all the episodes)
After some testing and consulting the listenNotes api docs I desiced to go with using theri search method which can be gicen a ocid (podcast_id) that limits the search to only episodes with the same podcast_id the only problem is that you can only get 10 episodes at atime and you have to provide a search term I tried with * but that did not function as a wildcard operator but I then realised that I could just search for the name of the podcast and that would always match all the episodes. I first just used the name of a podcast as a search term but soon realized that I needed to use URIencode to esscape special characters that somtimes apear in podcast names. I also did some minor imporvment to the error handleing.

Client side I created a new action for feching the episodes to a specific podcast and made it so that it would be triggerd after the intial data from the podcast was loaded, I also added a simple "infinate" scrolling  functionto allow user to load in more episodes just by scrolling down the page. I made some more styling adjustments but decided that I would not create the tre diffrent tabs for listened and not yeat listened episodes and just ceep it simple instead. This is becouse I realized that I'm actualy not saving what episodes the users have listened to in my api and whilst I have an id√© of how I could to that, it's will take a bit to much time in comperosen to what is gaind so I'm not going to preoratize that right now.

I also made a few smal buggfixes and fixed some spelling errors etc.
