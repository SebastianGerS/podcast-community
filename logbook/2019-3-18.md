# Converting to Typscript

Converting to Typescript was something I was planing to do before the actualt project started but it took longer then estimated and resulted in some filstructur changes, some due to longerfiles (Actions) and some changes where more due to a preexisting need to change the structure (Containers/Helpers).
I also hade to change some eslint setting and add a new transpiler and a new plugin to get eslint to work with Typescript.

The reason for me wanting to convert the codebase is several, for one it's common to use Typescript in many enterprises becouse of it's ability to help reduce likly buggs thanks to it's typesafe nature also it's something I have been interested in learning more about. The downside I guess is that becouse I'm not very used to writing Typescript it will probably take a bit longer then usual.

I was however able to finish the convertion of th existing code to day so I'm atlest hapy it didn't take that much time from the actual project.
