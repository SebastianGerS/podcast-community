# filters

I implemented the basics of the iu for the filters during the weekend with a section where the filters would be displayed and som simple funk to hide and show the filters I also added a new key to the search state to handle filters and connected the control of the inputs and select boxes to the redux store( normaly I set up controls for inputs etc by contectim them to the components state but this time I desided to to it a bit diffrently using the values from the store to controle the inputs and selects).

Today I have mostly been trying to create my own multi-select, I was baning my head against the wall for awhile trying to give a div (that was suposed to represent an option) a value and a name attribute but becouse thoes values not exists on the HTMLDivElement typescript would not let me add thoes attributes, tried to add a modified HTMLDivELement interface to the basic react types by declaring react module and exporting the new interface but did not get that to work, i also looked att useing the data-* attribute namings which I guess would have worked but I did not realy want to do it in that way and after a while a I realized that I did realy need to set the attributes on the div at all I could of course just trigger a function on click that just recives the relevent props from the react component it self. After I realized things started to move forward again, I have created a basic design for the multiselect and created all the basic func just some minor things left to do. So tomorrow hope I will be able to finish the rest of the func for filtering the search.
