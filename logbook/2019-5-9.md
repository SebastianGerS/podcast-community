# minor improvments and bugfixes

Today I have made some changes to how I'm working with dates in the frontend, I'm now using moment due to issues with browsers handleing date strings diffrently and moment enabels displaying date  and time in a consitent way.

I also made use of `skipWating()` on the service worker to force updateing to a new service worker version when ever it's changed. Also I updated the manifest.json with the correct start path (for some reason I hade set /index.html as the start path when it should be just /).

I made minor adjustments for the height of mediumheight modals, fixed a bug layout bug where notifications where wierdly stacked on smal ios devises and adjusted the error view to adjust it's font-sizes relative to the screen width.

I also did yet another change to the figcaptions in the feed view (made the text smaler and alowed for longer captions) I also reorderd the menu links and fixed a bug where /listeneing emitions did not always contain episode and podcast title, created a testUsers seeder and started to work on a bug where the duration for episodes where displayed as infinit and not enableing users to seek the position on ios devices.
