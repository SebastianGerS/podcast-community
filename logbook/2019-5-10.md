# more minor bugfixes and improvments

I think the issue with the audio is fixed now, not totaly convinced since it was a bit back and forth, but after clearing all caches and removing hitory of the site and restarting the browser on phone it actualy seamed to be working. The changes I made this time around was upgrading to the latest react-howler version and then adding a helper method to allow using the howler objects duration function only if it does not return infinity (which it seamd to do in ios) using the audio_length property of the episode instead. I also realized that two dragEnd cales where beeing made so I fixed this to.

I also made a few minor improvments like toggling the loginModal when trying to subscribe/follow a user and not logged in, made online status more reliable by always resetting sessions if the server restarts and always emiting online staus again from the client when reconnecting. Also made som minor styling improvments like fixing a issue with the notifications modal overflowwing verticly on smaler screens, adding more borader radius to cards and images and changing figcaption font-sizes and max length.


I fixed an issue where episodes in the podcast view could not be voted on due to the lack of an podcast_id prperty that was not return from the backend (due to the same issue as with podcast_title aka I forgot to check that the same values where beeing returned when switching from searching for episodes to fethcing them with the podcast).

I also fixed a bug where users could change their own profile images by clicking/draging and dropping a images on another users profile image, added func to togglemenu when logginout (the loggout button is in the menu), updated the delete user function in the backend to take in to also remove all references to the userId in other documents and event/notifcations, session that is connected to the user.
