# bugfixes and presentation

Yesterday I Fixed the issue with episodes for some individual podcasts not beeing fetched, I converted from using the listennotes search route for finding the episodes to using the built in pagination of the listennotes fetch route for a single podcast which let's you paginate the episodes returned with a podcast, I rewrote my route for fetching the podcast to only return the actual podcast the first time (no offset param is passed) and then only return the next batch of episodes to the user (when the offset param is passed).

Today I fixed the issue with markup (sometimes) in the desription and title of episodes and podcasts, I desided to use the interweave package that lets you pass a string with html to a Markup or Interweav component as content and then returns a div (or any valid element of your chosing) containing the rendered html this seams like a good way to to it and should prevent any XSS attacks. I also ended up doing som minor styling changes and modified the function I created for controling the length of strings renderd (used for instance to limit the length of the description), I realized that becouse the string sometimes contain html that was beeing counted as part of the length to so I added a check and saved all the matched html to a variable which I then could loop over and add the length of each match (that appers before the the disiered length of the string + any previusly accumilated length) so that the rendered string is not cut nedlessly short due to the html.

I then started working on the presentation of this project wrote a couple of pages and also made a keynote presentation, don't want it to long beocuse i do want some time to actually demo what I have done.
