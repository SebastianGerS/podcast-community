#Minor fixes and db documentation

To day I added func to stop episodes from playing when "dowloading" on ios devices, you can't actualy download episode to a ios device it's just opens up a new tab with just the mp3 and a basic play controles and start playing the file atomaticly so it makes sence to stop the file currently beeing played (if any) when downloding on i ios device.

I fixed a spelling error couseing podcasts to not be paginatable (aka could not paginate episodes) I also fixed decided to stop the service worker from beeing registered in safari browsers which seams to have solved the bug where episodes playing where not seekable (had something to do with the audio beeing locked after the pages reloeded becouse of some problem in the serviceworker).

I the updated the documentation for the api and also realized that I hade a problem with event's and notifications not beeing removed when deleting a user so I tried to fix this as well. I also created a variable for the documenation url link so that I can have diffrent links for diffrent enviroments.

I then used the program DbSchema to create a diagram of my database.
