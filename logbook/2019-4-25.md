# transitions for modal

Today I have looked at a few diffrent options for transitions (react-transition-group, overdrive and react-flip-toolkit)
I ended up implementing transitions for modals with the react-flip-toolkit tought it's not working so well for the modals that don't have a diffrent state that they should transition to, I hade to add a empty div to enable toes modals to have something to transition from and that worked for opening the modals but when they are closed they seam to just be removed from the dome right away. This might be due to how I have set up the my modals component that handles the selection of which modal if any should be rendered. 
At first I tought it could be becouse of a change I made where I actuly was just rendereing the same modal but just changeing what component the modal should render, but having diffrent components for each modal did not seam to make a differens. So i'm not sure of how I'm goining to solve this yeat, but will look some more at it to morrow.
