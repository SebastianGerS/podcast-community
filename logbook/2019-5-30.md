# bugfixes and improvments

Today I made sure that all buttons have the correct pointer cursor on hover and that buttons with no vissible text (just icons) display a tooltip when hovering as an extra help for understanding what the button is for.
I also shortend the max lentgth of captions for event images this makes the captions look better on smaler screens, I also fixed the issu with the top podcast items allowing text to overflow.

Then I added a new state to the modalReducer and a new action to allow reseting that state, the new state hasResized is used to help indicate that the window has resized and is pased to the modal component which then can re calculate it's height previusly it only recalulated it's height if the height of the window changed but since som other elements change height when the width is changed the modal needs to do that to. I also ended up doing som minor refactoring in the SiteRoute component that I hope will prove to be more efficient and made minor changes to the modal animations.
