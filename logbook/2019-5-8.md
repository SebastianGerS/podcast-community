# Audio and serviceworker

Today I think I managed to fix the audio problems, I realized that I could actualy use the audio link directly when using it via the howler component (but not when downloading) without getting a corse error and after switching to this way of fetching the audio for play back the problems with some audio files not beeing played on safari and firefox for ios dissapeard, not sure why thougt the content-type did not change so it can't be that they where octet-streams as I first tought.

I also made some adjustments and read a lot about service workers and now it's possible to add the app to the home screen on my phone (smothing that previusly hade been a problem) I think the problem was that I sometimes was getting the incroecct path to the service worker, I noticed for instance that if I was at /podcast/${someId}  on initial load the app would look for the service worker from that path and not from  just / so I hade to change the path in index.html from.

I'm still having some problems with how to invalidate the old caches and force the a updated serviceworker to be activated imidetly so will have to look some more at that. Also I found that some of the styling seams broken when runing it after adding it to the home screen nut sure why it could just be some setting in the manifest file but I could also bee that some csss is not suported in this mode.
