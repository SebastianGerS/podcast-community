# transitions

To day I changed how the modals rendered by the Modals component are transitioned, I now use react-transition-groups for this, it makes more sens then to use flip since it's only made for transitioning between diffrent components not for animating in a previusly unmounted component (which is the case for most of my modals). Still using flip for my menu and playback bars/modals since it works well to transition between the bar/modal states.

I also use react-transition-groups to animate in views, to a while before I finlay understood how I hade to do. still some problems tought I can't seam to animate it in from in full size since while beeing animated it seams to cover elements below eventought it actualy has a lower z-index and also it's currently only the enter animations that are working so I will have to look at this some more.
