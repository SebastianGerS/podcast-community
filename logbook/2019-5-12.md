# User deletion bugfix and more

So do day I revisited the delete function for users again and made some changes to ensure all references to notifications and events are removed when the user is deleted. I also fixed a issue in the front end where content would sometimes overflow in the listableEpisode/Podcast cards becouse of added line breaks in the extranal html ( I found that interweave hade an optinonal param that removes all line breaks in the html).

I also did a final deploy and some clean up and completed all the documentation.
